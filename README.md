## Choosing a new design

A new set of well-paired fonts for the website: 
- Slabo
- Montserrat 

Explanation: From the lecture, I wanted to choose Humanist Sans because I liked how the theme/mood is modern yet human. Since the website is about a certain city, it would be more exciting to the user if it seems like it's a friend writing the cool aspects of this city! It almost seems like they're listening to a tour guide and it's modern because they are learning about it right now! However, on google fonts, the examples of Humanist Sans fonts are not available for free. 

Therefore, I've decided to choose a free one that also gives me the same Humanist Sans mood. I've decided to choose Slabo font. It has a really nice legibility to it. I am able to read it smooth and fast. And then I decided to find another font to pair it with. There are several popular pairings that Google suggests, and I decided to choose Montserrat because (1) It has a really casual and relaxing mood to it. It's not too serious mood and that's good because I want to entice and amaze the reader to learn and hopefully visit the city someday. (2) It really pairs well with Slabo with the easy to read readibility and the casual-ness to it. It just fits well with the Humanist Sans theme I was talking about. 

I plan to use these two fonts in each page. The headings will take Slabo font because it has a sharpness to it. Then the paragraphs will take the Montserrat font because it has more relaxing mood to it so the user doesn't feel like it's reading a dense novel, it's more of a casual blog post! 

## Edit the CSS 

1. Add kearning or letter spacing 
Explanation: Montserrat seems to have a slight legibility and to fix that, adding a small amount of letter spacing can make it easier for the reader to read the text easier and stay on the website longer. 

2. Add line height to the paragraphs. 
Explanation: Montserrat looks close together and it may make it difficult for user to continue reading or it can be difficult to read if it's so close together. So adding a slight line height will help give it space and breathing room to read smoothly. It almost helps with feeling too suffocating. 

3. Add kearning to the headings 
Explanation: It has the same issue with the paragraph. The heading can use some of that help because Slabo also feels like it's really close gap with each letter. It also helps with making the heading fuller! 

4. Increase font size to headings
Explanation: The heading seems to be taking the smallest amount of space. It would help the user take in that the main point of each site will be talking about "history", "geography", etc. 

5. The contrast works well, so there isn't much I would change. The background color is white/light gradient of yellow and orange. The black text is readible and legible. To contrast heading and paragraph, there's a weight to the headings. 

## Summary 
Overall, I think this website looks really good because (1) it looks fuller and I think it does a good job of using the rule of third. Not everything is small and in the center only. (2) The 2 fonts incorporated adds a good mood to the website that it's casual and here to teach you a fun touristy experience! (3) The dynamic of just using 2 fonts instead of like 6 different onces initially is a great idea because it keeps things consistent, it loads faster, and it's a well-paired fonts for the website! All these reasons help improve legibility and readibility.
