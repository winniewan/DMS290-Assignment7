## Choosing a new design

A new set of well-paired fonts for the website: 
- Slabo
- Montserrat 

Explanation: From the lecture, I wanted to choose Humanist Sans because I liked how the theme/mood is modern yet human. Since the website is about a certain city, it would be more exciting to the user if it seems like it's a friend writing the cool aspects of this city! It almost seems like they're listening to a tour guide and it's modern because they are learning about it right now! However, on google fonts, the examples of Humanist Sans fonts are not available for free. 

Therefore, I've decided to choose a free one that also gives me the same Humanist Sans mood. I've decided to choose Slabo font. It has a really nice legibility to it. I am able to read it smooth and fast. And then I decided to find another font to pair it with. There are several popular pairings that Google suggests, and I decided to choose Montserrat because (1) It has a really casual and relaxing mood to it. It's not too serious mood and that's good because I want to entice and amaze the reader to learn and hopefully visit the city someday. (2) It really pairs well with Slabo with the easy to read readibility and the casual-ness to it. It just fits well with the Humanist Sans theme I was talking about. 

I plan to use these two fonts in each page. The headings will take Slabo font because it has a sharpness to it. Then the paragraphs will take the Montserrat font because it has more relaxing mood to it so the user doesn't feel like it's reading a dense novel, it's more of a casual blog post!
