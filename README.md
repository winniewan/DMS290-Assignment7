# Assignment 2: Github

Make improvements to Emma Campbell's Assignment 01. You can check out her
github repo ("https://github.com/emma-campbell/assignment01")

Improvements: 
* Layout: changed the image position for each html section/page. 
I have moved the image position from the top of the page to the bottom
of the page. I think this change is "better" in my opinion because 
I would want the audience or reader to grasp some of the information
from the paragraphs, have a visual in their head, and then check out what
it actually looks like. I think they are able to absorb more information that way. 
* Embellishment: I changed the navbar color to a sunset theme. The
sunset theme is yellow faded into orange. I think this is "better" 
in my opinion because the whole website was white and by changing the
navbar color, it separates the two sections: navbar and content. 
Additionally, it adds more depth and design than a white canvas as it was before.
* Important to note: The website is beautifully created by Emma for Assignment 1 under
a one week constraint.
