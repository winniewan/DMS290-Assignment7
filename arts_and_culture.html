            Columbus has a wide variety of museums and galleries. Its primary
            art museum is the Columbus Museum of Art, which operates its main
            location as well as the Pizzuti Collection, featuring contemporary
            art. The museum, founded in 1878, focuses on European and American
            art up to early modernism that includes extraordinary examples of
            Impressionism, German Expressionism, and Cubism. Another prominent
            art museum in the city is the Wexner Center for the Arts, a
            contemporary art gallery and research facility operated by the Ohio
            State University.

            COSI is a large science and children's museum in downtown Columbus.
            The present building, the former Central High School, was completed
            in November 1999, opposite downtown on the west bank of the River.
            In 2009, Parents magazine named COSI one of the ten best science
            centers for families in the country. Other science museums
            include the Orton Geological Museum and the Museum of Biological
            Diversity, both part of the Ohio State University.
