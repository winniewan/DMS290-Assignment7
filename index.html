          <h1>Columbus, Ohio</h1><br>
          <p>
            Columbus is the state capital and the most populous city in the U.S.
            state of Ohio. With a population estimated at 898,553 in 2019, it is
            the 14th-most populous city in the U.S., the second-most populous city
            in the Midwest after Chicago, and the third-most populous state
            capital. Columbus is the county seat of Franklin County; it also
            extends into Delaware and Fairfield counties. It is the core city of
            the Columbus, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses ten
            counties.[10] With a 2019 estimated population of 2,122,271, it is the
            largest metropolitan area entirely in Ohio.

            Columbus originated as numerous Native American settlements on the
            banks of the Scioto River. Franklinton, now a city neighborhood, was
            the first white settlement, laid out in 1797. The city was founded in
            1812, at the confluence of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and laid
            out to become the state capital. The city was named for Italian
            explorer Christopher Columbus. The city assumed the function of state
            capital in 1816 and county seat in 1824. Amid steady years of growth
            and industrialization, the city has experienced numerous floods and
            recessions. Beginning in the 1950s, Columbus began to experience
            significant growth; it became the largest city in Ohio in land and
            population by the early 1990s. The 1990s and 2000s saw redevelopment
            in numerous city neighborhoods, including downtown.

            The city has a diverse economy based on education, government,
            insurance, banking, defense, aviation, food, clothes, logistics,
            steel, energy, medical research, health care, hospitality, retail, and
            technology. The metropolitan area is home to the Battelle Memorial
            Institute, the world's largest private research and development
            foundation; Chemical Abstracts Service, the world's largest
            clearinghouse of chemical information; and Ohio State University, one
            of the largest universities in the United States. As of 2021, the city
            has the headquarters of five corporations in the U.S. Fortune 500:
            American Electric Power, L Brands, Nationwide, Alliance Data Systems,
            and Huntington Bancshares.
