            The confluence of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers is just north-west
            of Downtown Columbus. Several smaller tributaries course through the
            Columbus metropolitan area, including Alum Creek, Big Walnut Creek,
            and Darby Creek. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat
            topography thanks to a large glacier that covered most of Ohio
            during the Wisconsin Ice Age. However, there are sizable differences
            in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin
            County being 1,132 ft (345 m) above sea level near New Albany, and
            the low point being 670 ft (200 m) where the Scioto River leaves the
            county near Lockbourne. Numerous ravines near the rivers and creeks
            also add variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the
            Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto
            River cut through limestone.

            The city has a total area of 223.11 square miles (577.85 km2), of
            which 217.17 square miles (562.47 km2) is land and 5.94 square miles
            (15.38 km2) is water. Columbus currently has the largest land
            area of any Ohio city. This is due to Jim Rhodes's tactic to annex
            suburbs while serving as mayor. As surrounding communities grew or
            were constructed, they came to require access to waterlines, which
            was under the sole control of the municipal water system. Rhodes
            told these communities that if they wanted water, they would have to
            submit to assimilation into Columbus.
