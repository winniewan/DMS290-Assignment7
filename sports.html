            Columbus hosts two major league professional sports teams: the
            Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL) which play
            at Nationwide Arena and Columbus Crew SC of Major League Soccer
            (MLS) which play at Mapfre Stadium, the first soccer-specific
            stadium built in the United States for a Major League Soccer team.
            The Crew were one of the original members of MLS and won their first
            MLS Cup in 2008, with a second title in 2020. The Columbus Crew is
            scheduled to move into a new downtown stadium in the summer of 2021,
            which will also feature a mixed-use development site named
            Confluence Village.

            The Ohio State Buckeyes are a member of the NCAA's Big Ten
            Conference, and their football team plays home games at Ohio
            Stadium. The Ohio State-Michigan football game (known colloquially
            as "The Game") is the final game of the regular season and is played
            in November each year, alternating between Columbus and Ann Arbor,
            Michigan. In 2000, ESPN ranked the Ohio State-Michigan game as the
            greatest rivalry in North American sports. Moreover, "Buckeye
            fever" permeates Columbus culture year-round and forms a major part
            of Columbus's cultural identity. Former New York Yankees owner
            George Steinbrenner, an Ohio native who studied at Ohio State at one
            point and who coached in Columbus, was an Ohio State football fan
            and major donor to the university who contributed to the
            construction of the band facility at the renovated Ohio Stadium,
            which bears his family's name. During the winter months, the
            Buckeyes basketball and hockey teams are also major sporting
            attractions.
