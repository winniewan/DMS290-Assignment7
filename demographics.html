            Racial Distribution in Columbus [Red represents white Americans,

            Columbus historically had a significant population of white people.
            In 1900, whites made up 93.4% of the population. Though European
            immigration has declined, the Columbus metropolitan area has
            recently experienced increases in African, Asian, and Latin American
            immigration, including groups from Mexico, India, Somalia, and
            China. Although the Asian population is diverse, the city's Hispanic
            community is mainly made up of Mexicans, though there is a notable
            Puerto Rican population. Many other countries of origin are
            represented in lesser numbers, largely due to the international draw
            of Ohio State University. 2008 estimates indicate roughly 116,000 of
            the city's residents are foreign-born, accounting for 82% of the new
            residents between 2000 and 2006 at a rate of 105 per week. 40% of
            the immigrants came from Asia, 23% from Africa, 22% from Latin
            America, and 13% from Europe. The city had the second largest Somali
            and Somali American population in the country, as of 2004, as well
            as the largest expatriate Bhutanese-Nepali population in the world,
            as of 2018.

            Due to its demographics, which include a mix of races and a wide
            range of incomes, as well as urban, suburban, and nearby rural
            areas, Columbus is considered a "typical" American city, leading
            retail and restaurant chains to use it as a test market for new
            products.

            Columbus is home to a proportional LGBT community, with an estimated
            34,952 gay, lesbian, or bisexual residents. It has been rated as
            one of the best cities in the country for gays and lesbians to live,
            and also as the most underrated gay city in the country. In July
            2012, three years prior to legal same-sex marriage in the United
            States, the Columbus City Council unanimously passed a domestic
            partnership registry.
