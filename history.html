              Between 1000 B.C. and 1700 A.D., the Columbus metropolitan area
              was a center to indigenous cultures known as the Moundbuilders.
              The cultures included the Adena, Hopewell and Fort Ancient people.
              The only remaining physical evidence of the cultures are their
              burial mounds and what they contained. Most of Central Ohio's
              remaining mounds are located outside of Columbus city boundaries,
              though the Shrum Mound is upkept, now part of a public park and
              historic site. The city's Mound Street derives its name from a
              mound that existed by the intersection of Mound and High Streets.
              The mound's clay was used in bricks for most of the city's initial
              brick buildings; many were subsequently used in the Ohio
              Statehouse. The city's Ohio History Center maintains a collection
              of artifacts from these cultures.

              The area including modern-day Columbus once comprised the Ohio
              Country, under the nominal control of the French colonial empire
              through the Viceroyalty of New France from 1663 until 1763. In the
              18th century, European traders flocked to the area, attracted by
              the fur trade. The area was often caught between warring factions,
              including American Indian and European interests. In the 1740s,
              Pennsylvania traders overran the territory until the French
              forcibly evicted them. Fighting for control of the territory in
              the French and Indian War (1754-1763) became part of the
              international Seven Years' War (1756-1763). During this period,
              the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres, and battles. The
              1763 Treaty of Paris ceded the Ohio Country to the British Empire.
